## Create a New Metaspace

To create your own Metaspace, head to WWW and click "Create a Metaspace". Your new Metaspace is private; no one else can join until you invite them.

## Join an Existing Metaspace

You can join an existing Metaspace using either a URL or a numeric code. If you have a URL, navigate to the URL in your browser. If you have a numeric code, visit WWW to use it.

## Enter a Metaspace

Before entering a Metaspace you are in the Metaspace's lobby. You can see and hear what's going on in the Metaspace but you can only interact with the others using text chat. The process of entering a Metaspace is a bit different depending on your device.

### On Desktop / Mobile

Click "Enter Metaspace" and follow the prompts to select a username/avatar and set up your mic. On the final prompt select "Enter on Screen", or "Enter on Phone" if on mobile.

### On a Standalone VR Headset

If you opened the URL on your desktop or smartphone, choose "Enter on Standalone VR" to create a code that makes it easy to open on your standalone headset (e.g., Oculus Quest, Oculus Go, Samsung Gear).

### On a Wired-in VR Headset

We recommend [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) for wired-in headsets (e.g., Oculus Rift, Windows Mixed Reality, Vive). To use a desktop VR device with your headset, the Oculus app (Oculus Rift) or SteamVR (Windows Mixed Reality, Vive) must also be open.

On your computer, click "Enter Metaspace" and follow the prompts to select a username/avatar and set up your mic. On the final prompt before entering you should see an option to select "Connected VR Headset".

For troubleshooting information visit Metaspace [troubleshooting] page.

For Desktop VR (Oculus Rift, Windows Mixed Reality, or Vive) Metaspace works when used with a WebVR compatible browser (e.g., Firefox). Users must also have either the Oculus app (Oculus Rift), or SteamVR installed (Windows Mixed Reality, Vive).

For Standalone VR devices (Pico Neo 2, Oculus Quest and Oculus Go) Metaspace works in the Mozilla Firefox Reality Browser or the Oculus Browser.

Mobile phone powered VR systems, such as Samsung Gear and Google Cardboard, work using Google Chrome browser.

Note that some features may be limited on low-powered devices such as mobile phones.
