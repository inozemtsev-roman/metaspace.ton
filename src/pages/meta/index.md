Metaspace is a virtual collaboration platform that allows users to create their own 3D virtual spaces in their web browser with just one click, and then share the space with others by sending them a URL. No installation or downloading from an app store is required for users to collaborate in these virtual spaces. Additionally, Metaspace is powered by The Open Network (TON), a fully decentralized layer-1 blockchain designed by Telegram to onboard billions of users, boasting ultra-fast transactions, tiny fees, easy-to-use apps, and being environmentally friendly.
