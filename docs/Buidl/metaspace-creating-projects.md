In Buidl, you can either create a new project from Scratch, remix an existing Metaspace scene, or import a Buidl project someone sends you.

## Start a new project

To create a new Buidl project head to WWW and click ‘Get Started’.

![Buidl Landing Page]

If it's your first time, you will have the option to follow a tutorial to get familiar with the features. If you've created scenes in Buidl before and are signed in, you will see your previous projects listed here.

![Buidl Projects Page]

Select "New Project" and you'll be able to pick existing scenes from the community to remix or "New Empty Project" to start from scratch.

![Buidl Templates]

From here you can customize your scene entirely to your liking! Try [adding content] to your scene, or building a house with our [architecture kit].

## Remixing Scenes from Metaspace

Scenes that are published to Metaspace with a creative commons license are remixable. You can import them into Buidl from Metaspace as follows:

1. From inside a Metaspace using the scene open the dropdown menu
2. Select ‘Space & Scene Info‘
3. Click on the name of the scene to open its landing page
4. Select ‘Remix in Buidl‘

## Import a .metaspace file

If someone wants to share their Buidl scene with you without publishing it to Metaspace, they can export it as a .metaspace file. You can import .metaspace files as follows:

    Click the ‘New Project’ button
    In the menu, select File > Import legacy .metaspace project
    Select ‘Ok’ in the prompt (be careful of overwriting something you want to keep) and then select the desired file to upload.
