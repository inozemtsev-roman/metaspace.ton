# Welcome

Metaspace is a virtual world owned by its users, developed in the open and ready to grow with the contributions of people all around the globe.

This documentation details the Metaspace open protocol, everything from the architectural overview to the specific capabilities of each component. Here you'll find the resources you need to:

1. Design products and applications in the ecosystem
2. Conduct research and investigate the contents of the world
3. Create your own World Explorer
4. Pursue novel ideas that may end up in this list

**Let's build the Metaspace together!**

## Where to start?

If you don't know where to begin, it's a good idea to look at the [architecture]({{< relref "introduction/architecture" >}}) of the Metaspace protocol, to learn about the different components and their general purpose before diving into more detailed sections.

## Other resources

To get additional information and continue learning, you may want to check out:

- The [Ask Me Anything sessions], where members of the community can present questions, comments or concerns to technical teams at the Metaspace Foundation. They are hosted monthly, and you can attend freely!

- The [status page], to see the current platform status, incident history and some metrics.

- The [Architecture Decision Records], a collection of design documents describing the state and evolution of different aspects of Metaspace.

- [TON Metaspace organization in GitHub](https://github.com/tonmetaspace), where all the open-source repositories are hosted.
